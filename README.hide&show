This project includes a JavaScript feature that allows users to hide and show the temple image using buttons. When the Hide Image button is clicked, the temple image disappears from the screen. When the Show Image button is clicked, the temple image appears again. This improves user interaction and demonstrates basic DOM manipulation using JavaScript.
